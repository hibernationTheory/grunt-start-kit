# grunt-start-kit
### A Set of files to get started with grunt for your project

- This is a starter kit for using Grunt, the structure is built in a way that separates each indiviual Grunt plugin into it's own file. (inside the folder: /grunt/)
- These files make use of Grunt templates for having variables determine some parameters of them.
- Grunfile.js has different modes of build for different purposes.

### to get started
- adjust your package.json (change the 'CHANGE-ME' sections)
- install and configure more plugins as necessary.
